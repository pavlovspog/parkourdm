Garry's Mod - Parkour Deathmatch Gamemode
This is a work in progress and an attempt at making a custom parkour deathmatch gamemode for Garry's Mod. 
The goal is to have a working gamemode that will become the basis for a separate custom gamemode that a
friend and I are trying to create. I don't suggest trying to use any of this code for anything useful
as it's a first attempt from me to actually use lua and to code anything at all. That's all for now.
